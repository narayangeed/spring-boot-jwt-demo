# spring-boot-jwt-demo

We will be developing the project in stages
- Develop a Spring Boot Application to expose a Simple REST GET API with mapping /hello.
- Configure Spring Security for JWT. Expose REST POST API with mapping */authenticate* using which User will get a valid JSON Web Token. And then allow the user access to the api */hello* only if it has a valid token
